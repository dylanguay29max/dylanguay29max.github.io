    <h1>How To Fence Foil</h1>
    <p>Fencing is a sport that many people think of as sword fighting. However, there are many rules to the sport that people don't know. Right now, I will explain to you how to fence with a blade called a Foil, since this is the blade that I fence with.</p> 
    <h2>Gear</h2>
    <p>To fence with Foil, you will need this gear:<p/>
    <ol> 
        <li>Foil mask (helmet)</li>
        <li>Foil lame (electrical piece that covers the torso)</li>
        <li>Fencing jacket (goes under lame for extra protection)</li>
        <li>Fencing pants (optional)</li>
        <li>Under-arm protector (optional)</li>
        <li>Chest protector (optional)</li>
        <li>Mask cord and body cord (Important cords that connect all electrical components)</li>
        <li>Foil blade</li>
        <li>Fencing glove</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Rules For Fencing Foil</h2>
    <p>Now that you know the gear to fence Foil, here are the main rules.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Right of way (To gain right of way, you must be advancing or beat the opponent's blade. Whoever has the priority will get the point if they hit the opponent)</li>
        <li>You must hit with the tip of your blade on either the lame, or the bib of the mask. </li>
    </ol>
